# CMEE GroupWork Repository

*Author: Group 4*

*Created: Oct 2020*

This repository contains all the work attempted by CMEE Group 4 within "The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist" book which is taught in the first term of the CMEE Course.

Visitors who wish to attempt the coursework can refer to https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html

Each individual subdirectory will contain their own READMEs detailing the contents within the week. Also located within each subdirectories are another 3 subdirectories /Code, /Results and /Data. /Code contains the scripts, /Results contains the output from the scripts and /Data contains input files for the scripts. One point to highlight is that if input files are only manipulated (e.g. changing file type and/or replacing separators), the output remains in /Data. Outputs are only directed to /Results when the input files were processed (e.g. generating a graph from a dataset).
